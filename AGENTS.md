# kissclaw-tools - AI Agent Instructions

## Project

This repository is a MachineWisdom release-engineering toolkit for KissClaw and KissClawJJ.

## Shared Operating Rules

- Read the repo-local `AGENTS.md` first. Tool-specific files are additive and must not contradict it.
- Follow explicit operator instructions. Treat AI reviewer findings as evidence: verify and classify them before acting. Do not expand scope because a reviewer suggested it.
- Inspect the exact repo, branch, worktrees, and dirty state before editing. Preserve unrelated changes.
- Make tracked edits only on a dedicated worktree or feature branch. Keep the default checkout clean. Never commit or push directly to the default branch; land tracked changes through a pull request.
- Never force-push or amend a pushed commit. Stage explicit paths only; do not use `git add -A` or `git add .`.
- Resolve exact targets before destructive work. Do not discard changes, delete material data, merge, deploy, publish, post externally, or alter access without authority for that action.
- Never expose secrets. Keep provider credentials and user data within their authorized boundary.
- Treat `~/git/vendor/` checkouts as read-only. Develop in an owned repository or worktree.
- Route ambiguous new builds through `skills-sage` before coding. Use one shaping route; keep GStack/Pocock advice within the accepted outcome. Use `mw-implementation-stages` for multi-stage delivery or a stalled frontier, and `mw-review` for tracked review and non-converging repairs; use repo-local validation and workflow instructions.
- Keep durable non-trivial specs, plans, decisions, status, and handoffs in FAVA Trails. Promote finalized truth and sync it.
- Do not build “shared-something” helper identities. Use shared-all or shared-none; give shared artifacts one owner and one documented repair path.

## Repo Notes

- Read `README.md` for the import checker modes and validation contract.
- Use disposable worktrees for cherry-pick simulations; preserve source and baseline branches.

- Keep this file short and repo-specific.
- Put long runbooks, architecture, and operational detail in docs/ or FAVA Trails.

## Version updates

For a versioned change PR, follow [the version policy](docs/version-policy.md) and run the repository-local updater before review and after updating the branch from main. Keep commit and PR titles in Conventional Commits format.
